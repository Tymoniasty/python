# Write a Python program that uses three variables. The variables in your program will be animal,
# vegetable, and mineral. Assign a string value to each one of the variables. Your program should
# display "Here is an animal, a vegetable, and a mineral." Next, display the value for animal,
# followed by vegetable, and finally mineral. Each one of the values should be printed on their
# own line. Your program will display four lines in total.
animal = 'cat'
vegetable = 'broccoli'
mineral = 'gold'

print('Here is an animal, a vegetable, and a mineral.')
print(animal, vegetable, mineral, sep='\n')
